# EmailSorter

This project was created as a way for me to learn how to use python along side some libraries to make an app with the main function of sortings emails based on sender using the Gmail API.

Dependencies:
  * Custom Tkinter for the GUI
  * Pprint for the example and testing
  * Gmail API for the main functionality
  * PickleTools for Token Management
  * Os.path for File Management and checking

I'm still fairly new to using git and githun, also complete begginer with python, feel free to check out my source code and to give me suggestions.

I also plan to use this to add on to my future portfolio.
